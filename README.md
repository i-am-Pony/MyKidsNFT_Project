My Kids NFT is a complete project consisting of a collection of smart contracts working in unison, a Public Goods Fund, Community Resources, and hybrid art images, incorporating AI and generative art techniques, that were launched as NFTS on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) meant to raise funds, and bring awarness towards public good causes.

Our concept is simple yet effective.
Provide a safe environment where kids can learn about Block Chain technology, Web 3, AI, and all of the other aspects of the space. While building community and skills to last a lifetime. Through the use of NFTs, and the Metaverse, we seek to engage their minds and inspire their creativity.

We have also added many innovative features, like an NFT rentable marketplace, that allows users to purchase, sell and rent their My Kids NFT. A Redeem, where you can redeem our KIDS Tokens for NFTs, items and more.

The NFTS are visible in our metaverse [Spatial Gallery](https://www.spatial.io/s/My-Kids-NFT-6386a86c58fe6900016dc72c?share=1538196779924779088) open for public viewing. and on [OpenSea](https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/optimism-goerli/0x96bd02abae450090c1e06e511854760b61380cd3/1)

# OVERVIEW:

My Kids NFT through its very nature will help onboard kids in a fun way. This will instill a love for the Technology while developing a fundamental understanding of how it works. Through the use of blockchain, the metaverse, and fun challenges, kids learn healthy competition for success. These challenges will be games, activities, workshops and other exciting ways to gain points. These points unlock levels and Perks that reward the user for their hard work. Rewards can range from unlocked levels, badges, token, and even other NFTs wich enhance the ones they already own. These PFP are also their access to our members only areas within our Discord, Metaverse, events and more. They can earn unlimited token by completing fun learning tasks that help them learn about the space.

Even better, we have added an NFT Rental Marketplace! Here kids can learn and earn while strengthening their entrepreneurial skills. While renting out their NFTs, their users can partake in all of the benefits of owning a My Kids NFT. Without having to relinquish ownership. Thus teaching them even more life enhancing skills, and gaining even more from their NFT.

However, that is only part of the community at MKN. We also provide many free, fun activities where kids can partake even without ownership! There are also many chances to win a free My Kids NFT. Holders do have added perks, our NFT's are intended to be a users' access to the "VIP" metaverse, and holders only areas within the community, but there is still plenty of free goods, and we welcome everyone to come join the family.

Our KIDS token will also be air dropped to all holders on a monthly basis. These are in house utility tokens, that are redeemed towards many rewards that are added often through collaborations and more.

# PUBLIC GOODS FUND:

There are also plans for an international Summer Camp, where children get immersive learning, and a nutritional meal while having a blast. This is just one way we plan to give back to the Community. Check the Summer Camp Proposal for details.

# THE NUMBERS:

Through a Series of NFT drops, My Kids NFT seeks to fund blessings for many generations to come. Starting with Our Genesis Collection of 5k Hybrid NFTs, priced at roughly 0.035 eth / $40 USD. Which is low enough for most people, from all walks of life, worldwide to afford. It is actually less than the average price for a family of 4 to eat at McDonald's. We did this strategically to ensure that all children can be included in this community.

# SUMMARY:

In brief, My Kids NFT seeks to set a higher standard for utility and value within an NFT, to its holders. It simultaneously will help enrich the lives and education of Children through multi faceted venues that will shape our future world leaders.

Help us make a difference. Support our project, and give kids a boost to get started ahead in the right direction.
